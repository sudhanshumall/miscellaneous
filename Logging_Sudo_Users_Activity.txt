As a DevOps Engineer/Linux Admin/Linux Security Analyst, you might come into a situation where you have given Linux Machine access to your Development team but you don't know what command those guys are running on the Linux machine.

So, this becomes very important for us to monitor their activity in terms of the command they are firing on the machine.

Logging sudo users activity helps us to identify the USER command in case of any failure.

Here we will Log  SUDO users activity as well as we will send mail to mentioned mail id in case if someone uses command with SUDO.

Follow below steps to log sudo users activity:

1) Login as root
2) chmod 640 /etc/sudoers (by default /etc/sudoers file has only read access)
3) vim  /etc/sudoers

added below lines in /etc/sudoers file

###### Log sudo users activity and get mail if they uses command with sudo  ####
Defaults        syslog=auth, insults, syslog_goodpri=alert
Defaults        logfile=/var/log/sudo.log
Defaults        timestamp_timeout=0, log_year, tty_tickets
Defaults        mailto="mall.sudhanshu90@gmail.com", mail_always, mail_badpass, mail_no_user

Save and Exit

Explanation of above lines:

mail_always -  Will send mail to the mailto user every time a users runs sudo. This flag is off by default.

mail_badpass - Will send mail to the mailto user if the user running sudo does not enter the correct password. This flag is off by default.

mail_no_user - If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user is not in the sudoers file. This flag is on by default.

logfile - All the logs will be saved into the path specified here and you will be able to see all the fired command by the Developers.

4) Make sure to change the file permission of "/etc/sudoers"

chmod 440 /etc/sudoers

=======================================================================
There might be situation where you do not want to send mail if someone fires command using sudo.

In this case, you can comment last line ie.

#Defaults        mailto="mall.sudhanshu90@gmail.com", mail_always, mail_badpass, mail_no_user
